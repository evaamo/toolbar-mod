ToolBar Mod for MSFS 2024

The Toolbar Mod for MSFS2024 toggles the toolbar on and off completely from your main sim window!. This mod not only provides more immersion and better screenshots, but it gives you back important screen real state lost to the huge invasive MSFS2024 toolbar.

Tired of trying to click that overhead button and the toolbar gets in the way?

Trying to set that particular zoomed custom view to click on something but you can't because the invasive toolbar appears?

Suffer no more!!!

Installation is simple: unzip and drag the mod folder into your community folder. Once you load the simulator and go flying, use the key combination: CTRL-ALT-T and voila! Toolbar gone. Use the same key combination and you get it back. Simple!.

This took hours of fighting Microsoft/Asobo's Javascript! 

### ========IMPORTANT===============

Tested in MSFS 2024 SU3. Reported to work fine in SU4.

This has been tested as much as possible. However, there's TONS of room for improvement.

Let me know if you hit any issues in the comments below.

### ========RECOMMENDED=============

If you have many Icons in the Toolbar, you should use the The Wrapping-toolbar by luzat . It is more reliable than the scrolling behavior by Asobo's faulty Toolbar.

### ========CREDITS=================

Kudos to the folks at Parallel 42 for their msfs-toolbar-interop idea!!!
